        <h1>Output Score Calculation Framework</h1>
        <p>A quantitative approach to measuring athletic performance through physics-based metrics</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The output score is a measure of the physical work and power exerted by
          an athlete during an exercise. It provides a quantitative way to evaluate
          performance by applying basic physics principles. This framework supports
          a wide range of exercises, including weightlifting, bodyweight
          movements, cardio activities, and stationary equipment metrics.

          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>
            In physics, work is defined as the force applied to an object times
            the distance it moves in the direction of the force:
          </p>
          <div className="formula">
            <code>W = F Ã— d</code>
          </div>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>W = Work (measured in Joules)</li>
            <li>F = Force applied (measured in Newtons)</li>
            <li>d = Distance moved (measured in meters)</li>

        <div className="principle">
          <h3>Power</h3>
          <p>
            Power is the rate at which work is performed:

          <div className="formula">
            <code>P = W/t</code>

          <ul>
            <li>P = Power (measured in Watts)</li>
            <li>W = Work (measured in Joules)</li>

          <h3>Dynamic Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            Each exercise has a specific output function defined in a modular
            system. The appropriate function is resolved dynamically at runtime
            based on the exercise category and name, ensuring scalability and
            clear separation of logic.
